# Bork Souls

Bork Souls is my own personal project that I have been working on. It is a role-playing game that will have a lot of rogue-like characteristics. I plan on using object-oriented python for the bulk of the game. Python also has a lot of GUI's that are easily imported and used which will be very helpful. 

Eventually I would like to incorporate an enemy AI system using some sort of machine learning model.
